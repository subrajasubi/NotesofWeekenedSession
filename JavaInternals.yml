Brief about how java works:
===========================
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be portable, meaning that it can 
run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. 

Writing code: Java code is written using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is a machine-readable code that can be run on any platform that has 
a JVM installed.

Compilation: Once the Java code is written, it is compiled into bytecode by a Java compiler. The bytecode is 
stored in .class files.

Execution: When the Java program is executed, the JVM reads the bytecode and interprets it. The JVM is 
responsible for converting the bytecode into machine code that can be run on the platform.
