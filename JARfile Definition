JAr file:
==========
A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a file format used to package multiple Java class files and associated resources 
into a single file. Think of it like a "zip file" for Java programs. It makes it easier to distribute and share Java
programs, as all the necessary files are packaged into one file.

To understand JAR files better, let's use an analogy. Imagine that you are packing for a trip, and you have many 
items that you need to take with you, such as clothes, toiletries, and electronics. You could put each item into a 
separate bag and carry them individually, but that would be inconvenient and time-consuming.

Instead, you could use a suitcase to pack all your items into a single container. The suitcase acts as a container, 
and you can easily carry everything you need in one place.

Similarly, a JAR file acts as a container for all the files needed to run a Java program. The Java files and other 
resources are packaged together into a single JAR file, making it easier to distribute and 
run the program on different computers.
