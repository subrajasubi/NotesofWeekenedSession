Control statements:
==================
  while:
  ======
  int i = 1;

while (i <= 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}

Difference between break and continue:
=====================================
  The main difference between break and continue is that break is used to terminate the loop and continue 
  execution outside the loop, while continue is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue 
  with the next iteration.

In more detail:

break statement: When break is encountered in a loop, it immediately exits the loop and transfers control to 
the statement immediately following the loop. This means that the code outside the loop block is executed, and 
the loop is not executed further. break is often used to terminate an infinite loop or to exit a loop early if a 
certain condition is met.

continue statement: When continue is encountered in a loop, it skips the current iteration of the loop and 
moves on to the next iteration. This means that the code inside the loop block is skipped for the current 
iteration, but the loop itself continues to execute. continue is often used to skip over certain iterations of 
a loop based on a certain condition.

In summary, break is used to completely terminate the loop and continue execution outside the loop, 
while continue is used to skip over the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration.
