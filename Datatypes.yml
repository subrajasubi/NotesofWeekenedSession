Datatypes:
===========
  In computer programming, a data type refers to the classification or categorization of data items 
  based on the type of value they represent. Data types determine the type of operations that can be performed 
  on the data and the way the data is stored in the computer's memory.

Primitive and non-primitive datatypes:
======================================
  Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of a programming language and are defined by the language 
  itself. They include simple data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and Boolean 
  values. These data types are usually represented directly in memory, and the operations that can be performed 
  on them are also defined by the language.

Non-primitive data types, on the other hand, are more complex data structures that are built using primitive 
data types. They include arrays, strings, structures, and classes. These data types are usually defined by the 
programmer and can have different operations and properties depending on their implementation

1 byte ranges from 0 to 255?:
=============================

A byte is made up of 8 bits, each of which can have one of two values (0 or 1), giving a total of 2^8 (or 256) 
possible combinations of 0s and 1s. In many computing systems, bytes are typically used to represent small 
integer values, ranging from 0 to 255 (inclusive), using a binary representation.

For example, the decimal number 42 can be represented in binary as 00101010. 
This binary representation can be stored in a byte and then used in computing operations. Similarly, 
the ASCII code for the letter 'A' is 65, which can also be represented using a byte.

Range:
======
   1byte= 2^8 (or 256)
   2byte=  2^16 (-32,768 to 32,767)
   4byte= 2^32(-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
   8byte=  2^64 ( -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
