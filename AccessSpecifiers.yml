Access Specifiers:
==================
The scope of these access specifiers is as follows:

public: A public member can be accessed from anywhere in the program. This means that any class, regardless of 
its package, can access public members.

protected: A protected member can be accessed within its own package and by any subclass, even if it is outside 
the package.

private: A private member can only be accessed within the class in which it is defined.

Default (package-private): A default member (without any access specifier) can only be accessed within its own 
package. This means that any class in the same package as the default member can access it, but classes outside 
the package cannot.
