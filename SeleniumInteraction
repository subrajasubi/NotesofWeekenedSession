In Selenium, an automation script interacts with the browser in the following way:

First, the script creates a WebDriver instance, which acts as a bridge between the script and the browser.

Then, the script navigates to a specific webpage by calling the get() method on the WebDriver instance and passing in the URL of the webpage.

Once the webpage has loaded, the script interacts with the elements on the page, such as buttons, links, and input fields. To do this, 
the script uses the WebDriver instance to locate the element on the page and perform an action, such as clicking a button or entering text into an input field.

The script can also navigate between different pages by calling the get() method again with a new URL.

As the script interacts with the browser, the WebDriver instance communicates with the browser driver, which is a separate executable
that controls the browser. The browser driver receives commands from the WebDriver instance, translates them into actions that the browser can understand,
and sends them to the browser.

The browser then performs the requested actions, such as clicking a button or navigating to a new page.

Finally, the script can verify that the correct actions were performed by checking the webpage's content, such as by checking the text of a page element or 
by verifying that a specific element is present on the page.

In summary, an automation script in Selenium interacts with the browser through a WebDriver instance, which communicates with the browser driver to control 
the browser and perform actions on webpages
